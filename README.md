# BDOS (Bigdata for official statistics)


The aim of this project is to deploy a machine learning algorithm on time-series data. Data is taken from BIS
statistics, compiled in cooperation with central banks and other national authorities. Information about analysis of
financial stability, international monetary spillovers and global liquidity are available. I took the property price for
23 different countries as target variable to be predicted for unseen quarters. 

In the first file you can find neoral network LSTM and in the second one the machine learning algorithm.
